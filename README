To start the program, use Python to run home.py file.

There are required python libraries to run this program.
The following are the packages required:

pyqt5, Faker, numpy, pandas, pyyaml

Please install all of the packages listed above before you run home.py file on Python.

There is an option for the user to specify which probability distributions to use when generating the patients' age.
Normal, Binomial, Poisson are the ones available.

The user can also upload a YAML configuration file instead of setting the parameters via the UI. The followings are examples on how to set up the files.

For Normal distribution:
      age:
          distribution: normal
          mean: int (any number greater than 0)
          sd: float (any number greater than 0)

For Binomial distribution:
      age:
          distribution: binomial
          n: int (any number greater than 0)
          p: float (any number between 1 and 0)
          
For Poisson distribution:
      age:
          distribution: poisson
          lam: int (any number greater than 0)

For the Number of Records to Generate Using Random Format:
      records:
          rows: int (any number greater than 0)
          
For the Number of Records to Generate Using OMOP CDM Format:
      records:  
          person: int (any number greater than 0)
          specimen: int (any number greater than 0)
          measurement: int (any number greater than 0)
          observation: int (any number greater than 0)
